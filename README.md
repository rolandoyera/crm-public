## Initial Setup

You'll need a Firebase account to run this app on your own:

1. Populate the .env file with your web app's Firebase configuration.
2. Set up email authentication with Firebase to login.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start` or `yarn start`

Runs the app in development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Motivation

I built this CRM for a health and life insurance broker to track their clients along with their policies. You can print or download completed applications, manage tasks and "follow" clients that are marked as important to keep them front and center. Separate tables are available to sort and filter customers and policies for insight or to download in csv format to use for marketing or other purposes. Charts are avaiable for customer insight.

This app uses the following technologies:

1. Firebase for data and authentication
2. Search powered by Algolia
3. React
4. MUI
5. Apex Charts
6. React PDF Renderer

This is an ongoing project so features and changes are constantly being commited.
